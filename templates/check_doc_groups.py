"""Fail if a public symbol is documented but not organized into any \\ingroup.

Doxygen's WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED (see ../Doxyfile) already fails the build for a
symbol with *no* documentation at all -- but a symbol can carry a perfectly
good \\brief/\\param/\\return and still have no \\ingroup tag. Doxygen stays
silent about that: the symbol still gets documented, it just never appears
under any group in groups.dox, so it's effectively invisible in the
generated site's navigation.

This script closes that gap by cross-referencing Doxygen's own XML output
(see GENERATE_XML in ../Doxyfile; run `doxygen Doxyfile` first) rather than
re-parsing C++ itself:

  - A member (free function, variable, enum, typedef) declared directly in a
    namespace shows up in that namespace's XML as a lightweight
    `<member refid="group__...">` stub when it has an \\ingroup -- Doxygen
    moves its full definition into the group compound. One with no \\ingroup
    keeps its full `<memberdef>` inline in the namespace file instead. That
    distinction is exactly "grouped or not."

  - A struct/class/union declared directly in a namespace always appears as
    an `<innerclass>` there regardless of grouping (that's structural, not
    documentation-driven) -- so those are instead checked by cross-referencing
    every group__*.xml's own `<innerclass>` listing.

A symbol that is deliberately not part of the documented surface is not a
failure here -- but note that Doxyfile's EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS is *not* the way to
get that: it only drops a symbol out of group listings, it still shows up as
a fully documented namespace member (with its \\brief and all), which is
exactly the "ungrouped, no page" problem this script (and the docs site's own
build) flags. Wrap the symbol in `//! \\cond DOXYGEN_EXCLUDE` / `//! \\endcond`
instead -- that removes it from Doxygen's output entirely, so there is
nothing left for this script (or the site) to trip over.

Usage: python3 check_doc_groups.py [--xml-dir doxygen-xml]
(run from wherever the Doxyfile lives, after `doxygen Doxyfile`)
